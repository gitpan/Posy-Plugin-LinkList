==== NAME ====

Posy::Plugin::LinkList - Posy plugin to give a dynamic list of links


==== VERSION ====

This describes version ``0.40'' of Posy::Plugin::LinkList.


==== DESCRIPTION ====

This provides a method which can be called from the "head" flavour template
(if one is using the TextTemplate plugin). When given an array of labels and
a hash of labels-to-relative-links, will produce a list of links which take
account of (a) what the current path is and (b) what the current flavour is.
If the link matches the current path, then only the label is used for that
link. If the extension part of the link matches the default flavour, then
the current flavour replaces it.

With extra arguments, will change the style of the list; one can define
pre_list, post_list, pre_item, post_item, and item separators -- this
enables one to create an unordered list or a pipe-separated paragraph just
by changing these values. Or one can give one's own CSS classes to the
parts. The default is a plain <ul> list.
